## TooDoo

The scope of this project was to build a to-do web application. The intend was to improve my back-end skills with node.js and later I decided to use firebase to get a feel on working with api's in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

- Users can log in and sign out with google pop-up.
- The to-do items can be added, edited, deleted, completed and prioritized.
- When users are not logged in they cannot see items.

The front-end is fully responsive but basic, with the focus for me being on the back-end functionalities.

For this project I used Next.js(React).
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the front-end styling and javascript for back-end. As mentioned I used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentification and firestore(firebase) for the database.
